### However, the project needs `a few changes `  to let us able to review it. 




.

> The project has **only** ` one link` as a story, So we need to :


.

.


##  1 . Require 

===============

You need to create **Three separate visualizations**:

.

 > - **Two single worksheets **



These can be two single worksheets, two more dashboards, two more stories, or any combination of worksheets, dashboards, or stories.




> -  **One single worksheet**  as a dashboard.  





.



## Let me explain here

============================

This is a bit confusing part of the rubric as you're supposed to create a dashboard that counts as a separate visualization.


.

## For example,

==============



> let's say you've created 4 worksheets - W1, W2, W3, and W4.



You can use W3 and W4 to create a dashboard. W3 and W4 are not to be submitted as visualizations in your project.



- So your three visualizations would be W1, W2, and the dashboard.
