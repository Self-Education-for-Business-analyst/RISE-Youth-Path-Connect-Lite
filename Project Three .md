> ## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

=================================

- All SQL `queries run without errors`  and produce the intended results.

- The student has used `at least 4 unique` SQL queries in their submission.

- All visualizations include a `title and axis labels, have a legend`  where applicable, and are easily understood.

- `A PDF` report has been uploaded and `a .txt` file with the queries has been uploaded in a single zipped folder file as mentioned in [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPI-EEfydH0)


-  `SQL queries:`   as mentioned in [this video link]()
    
    -  Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit join

> ## Entity Relationship Diagrams


=============================


**An entity-relationship diagram (ERD)** is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the ERD for the database we will use from Parch & Posey. These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:



- The names of the tables.

- The columns in each table.


- The way the tables work together.

.


> **SQL ** A language that allows us to access data stored in a database.
